>Everyone has the wish to learn something new. Something new through which they can acquire new skills and transform their lives. But obviously, this comes with the cost and it is not even questionable why so. But, there are always loops to everything and this article will take you through that loop. So that your wish to learn something new is fulfilled and you do not even have to look into your pockets. Without wasting further time, Lets dive right into it!

<h1>Step 1- Installing Python</h1>
Before starting, you have to make sure that you have the latest version of Python installed on your PC. If you don’t, you can install the Python setup file from this link- https://www.python.org/downloads

<h1>Step 2- Installing the Repository</h1>
Now, this is where everything REALLY begins. Go to GitHub (click here) and download the “Udemy Course Enroller” zip file under code. As you can see below:-  <br/>

<h1>Step 3- Extracting the File</h1>
Next, extract the file inside to whatever location you want. (I’d suggest desktop simply)

<h1>Step 4- Running “requirements” file</h1>
Inside the file, you will see a file named “requirements.py”. Run this file through python. This will install all the necessary files that you need for the main code  <br/>

![requirements.py](https://i0.wp.com/raniac.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/VLC-15-12-2020-19_12_16.png?resize=768%2C432&ssl=1)
<h1>Step 5- The Configuration</h1>
In that folder itself, there would a file named “sample_settings”. Open that file and follow the instructions written on the left and key in your credentials accordingly  <br/>

<h1>Step 6- Running the Code</h1>
Now, you are all ready to get yourself enrolled in the courses of your choice. Open a file named “autorun.bat”. If you are met by a pop-up, ignore that, its just a way of Windows stopping a cmd file that was not made locally. Press on “more info”, and “Run Anyways”.
Now, your code has started running  <br/>

![running](https://i2.wp.com/raniac.in/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/VLC-15-12-2020-19_14_10.png?resize=768%2C432&ssl=1)
  <br/><br/>
You will see that the browser gets opened, your username password gets keyed in and you are on the welcome screen of Udemy.

<h1>The End</h1>
That is all! Now the bot will enroll you in numerous courses on Udemy all for free! Keep Learning and all the best  <br/>
