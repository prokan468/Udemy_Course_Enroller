So that your wish to learn something new is fulfilled and you do not even have to look into your pockets. Without wasting further time, Lets dive right into it!

Step 1- Installing Python
Before starting, you have to make sure that you have the latest version of Python installed on your PC. If you don’t, you can install the Python setup file from this link- https://www.python.org/downloads/

Step 3- Extracting the File
Next, extract the file inside to whatever location you want. (I’d suggest desktop simply)

Step 4- Running “requirements” file
Inside the file, you will see a file named “requirements.py”. Run this file through python. This will install all the necessary files that you need for the main code.

Step 6- Running the Code
Now, you are all ready to get yourself enrolled in the courses of your choice. Open a file named “autorun.bat”. If you are met by a pop-up, ignore that, its just a way of Windows stopping a cmd file that was not made locally. Press on “more info”, and “Run Anyways”.
Now, your code has started running.

Success
You will see that the browser gets opened, your username password gets keyed in and you are on the welcome screen of Udemy.

The End
That is all! Now the bot will enroll you in numerous courses on Udemy all for free! Keep Learning and all the best!
